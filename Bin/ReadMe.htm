<a onclick="javascript:change('<b><u>Getting Started</b></u><br>This is a small tutorial that will give you the basic info you need to run BH Cloak. So first off, please open up BH Cloak. Then select a window youd like to cloak (See the Topic: <i>Selecting Windows</i> for help). Then press F6, BH Cloak and the window should dissapear. After that, press Ctrl+B+H, Cloak should reapear, but the window should still be hidden, to make the window appear again, click: <i>Show All Selected Windows</i>. This is the basic function of Cloak. But there are other features as well, so select something again, then right click it in the list. A list of options should appear. Feel free to experiment with the options, and if you have an idea of another option to add that might be useful, please email me or IM me over MSN, mine is: Brownhead622@hotmail.com. Anyways, select a bunch of windows, hide them all, then close BH Cloak without showing the rest of the windows. Now open it back up and goto File->Recover All Cloaked Windows, or File->Recover Last List. You can see that its very unlikely that youll ever lose a window :D.')">Getting Started</a>
<br><a onclick="javascript:change('<b><u>Selecting Windows</b></u><br>There are 3 ways to select a window. Combined they can hopefully meet all your needs.<br><b>Drag & Drop - </b>The simplest out of the 3 the Drag & Drop option allows you to select a window by first moving the mouse over the button, and clicking down the left mouse button, then without releasing the mouse, dragging the cursor over the window you would like to select. Then let go. The window you released the mouse button over should now be added to the list. You may release the mouse button anywhere over the desired window, unless you disabled the <i>Owner Loop</i> (Get more information on the Owner Loop in the FAQ).<br><b>Selecting From a List - </b><br>This method is fairly self explanatory. Click on the buttons and then a dialog box will appear. Than in the textbox thats under the list of windows, type in the caption of the window you are selecting. When it has been highlighted in the list, press enter or press select, and the window will be added to the list.<br><b>By Type - </b>This ones a little strange. When you click the button a dialog will appear listing a few different type of applications, such as FireFox, Internet Explorer, and Windows Explorer. Select the type of window youd like to select than any window that falls under the type selected will be added to the list.')">Selecting Windows</a>
<br><a onclick="javascript:change('<b><u>Hiding and Showing Windows</b></u><br>After you have selected some windows you will be able to hide them. The primary method of hiding them is by hotkey (Defualt is F6), so that when you press the hotkey, all the windows youve selected will be instantly hidden. Then when you press the other hotkey (Default is Ctrl+B+H) BH Cloak will appear and then you can make the desired windows appear again. If you accidently open close BH Cloak with windows still hidden, you can recover them (See the topic:<i>Recovering Lost Windows</i>). Another fail safe is that you can save the window list, and then if BH Cloak is closed you can simply open it again (Do this from File->Save and File->Open)')">Hiding and Showing Windows</a>
<br><a onclick="javascript:change('<b><u>Recovering Lost Windows</b></u><br>Since I dont want anyone to lost there work, I made 2 recovery options. The first is an auto-save feature. Itll save your list to a backup file every time you hide all the windows on your list (Using the button or Hotkey). You can recover the autosave by going to: File->Recover Last List. But there is also another method that is extremly powerful. Goto File->Recover All Cloaked Windows, and BH Cloak will look at every single window open, and all of their child windows to see if they are cloaked, if they are, Cloak will add them to the list.')">Recovering Lost Windows</a>
<br><a onclick="javascript:change('<b><u>Setting the Hotkeys</u></b><br>Setting hotkeys in BH Cloak is an extremly easy endeavor. Simply clickt he button labeled: Set Hotkeys, and a window will popup with 2 textboxes. The top one is the hotkeys that will make all the windows dissapear, the bottom one is the hotkeys that will make BH Coak appear again. TO set the hotkeys, click on one of the textboxes, and hold the keys you want to become hot down. Then when your done setting them, click Save Changes. Or if you dont want to change anything, click the X at the top right of the Hotkey selection window.')">Setting the Hotkeys</a>
<br><a onclick="javascript:change('<b><u>FAQ</u></b><br><i>Q: What does the Toggle <b>Owner Loop</b> loop option do?<br><b>A: When you have the Owner Loop enabled, it allows you to click on any part of a window and itll select it, but if you disable it you will be able to select child windows as well (TextBoxes, Buttons, Icons...)</b><br><i>Q: What is saving the list good for?</i><br><b>A: Saving the list allows you to make a reliable backup of your list, so in case it gets lost youll still be able to recover it quickly.')">FAQ</a>
