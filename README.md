# Cloak

## What is Cloak?

Cloak allows you to select any number of windows and a hotkey to hide all of those windows immediately when pressed (and another hotkey to bring them back). Additional features include an array of recovery options (if you forget the hotkey or something happens, just open another instance and select *Recover All Cloaked Windows*), the ability to change window captions, and the ability to set the translucency of windows.

## History

This is a project I made when I was very young (if I recall correctly I created the first version in 6th grade, this is the third version which was finished sometime within or near 8th grade). As such, not everything about it makes sense. For example, the `Bin` directory is a "file bin" of sorts (holding configuration and other related files) rather than a directory to hold binaries.

Though I created this project I had a bad habit of hacking things together from various sources when I was younger, so I am not sure about the licensing on all of this code. Please tell me if you find code that I should not be distributing and I will wipe it from the repo.
